                The data-bookshop-live attribute enables live editing previews in CloudCannon.
                To enable live previews of new components, all components are rendered
                via a page component that expects an array of content blocks.

                data-bookshop-props is used to control what front matter to bind to.
                Here we want to bind to all the front matter, so that page.content_blocks
                is accessible from the bookshop renderer.

                This element will get picked up by the bookshop dev renderer if present,
                on production this does nothing.

                Bookshop components are accessed using the bookshop tag, 
                using the same syntax as the standard Jekyll include tag.
